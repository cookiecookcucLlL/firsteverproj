Hahah, I just made my first commit! Or i think so since I just created acc awhile ago.
I will be doimg logs of what I'm doing all this time (I hope majority of the time I will be coding instead).

Day 1: I just created my first repo! That kinda counts as an activity.

Day 2: This time around I configured my hyprland setup(which is still shit btw) by changing the border color, wallpaper and key bindings(that's basically it). I have done a great job by "channeling" some amount of the left energy into this or else(lol,initially I wanted to download someones dotfile but since I'm newbie I didn't understand anything so here we are...). 

Day 3 & 4: Weekends cause yes

Day 5:
