Hahah, I just made my first commit! Or i think so since I just created acc awhile ago.
I will be doimg logs of what I'm doing all this time (I hope majority of the time I will be coding instead).

Day 1: I just created my first repo! That kinda counts as an activity.

Day 2: This time around I configured my hyprland setup(which is still shit btw) by changing the border color, wallpaper and key bindings(that's basically it). I have done a great job by "channeling" some amount of the left energy into this or else(lol,initially I wanted to download someones dotfile but since I'm newbie I didn't understand anything so here we are...). 

Day 3 & 4: Weekends cause yes

Day 5: didn't do shit cause yeah but atleast I remembered about this

Day 6: Let's pretend I actually done something cause well... I just learned that git and github is two separate entities and that I'm a complete noob for all of this. Plus why is my text looking so shitty when I "commit" it? There's too much things to learn for me at once and I'm overwhelmed... This stupid AI can't give me proper instruction to do anything and it also gives out unworking scripts so I have to do everything manually... Fuck me... Am I screaming to void? Will I overcome this hurdle or will I be stuck in the same shit?
